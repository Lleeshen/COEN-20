# COEN 20 Labs

Embedded Systems/Assembly Labs
Class taken Spring 2018

Lab 1: Convert signed and unsigned numbers between Decimal and Binary, using Two's Complement (in C).

Lab 2: Return numbers and other things from functions with parameters in Assembly.

Lab 3: Copy 512 bits using different types of LDR instructions.

Lab 4: Find Pixel Addresses and BitMap Addresses given pixel location.
      This is used in the driver main program to generate fractals.

Lab 5: Insert and delete values from an array while preserving order.

Lab 6: Insert and get nibble(4-bit) values from array that represent nibble values
       This is used in the driver program to solve soduku puzzles autonomously.

Lab 7: Compare performance of dividing by a constant using DIV and optimization with multiply
      Optimized division by constant code generated lab7-IntegerDivisionByConstant.c

Lab 8: Compare performance of evaluating a polynomial with floating registers and fixed point reals;  
      Driver function uses this to show sine wave graph.

Lab 9: Use SIMD and Saturating Functions to modify picture;
      Driver function provides picture and ability to modify RGB
